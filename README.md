# Product-Recommendation-System-for-Retail-Sector-using-Deep-Learning-
Deep learning-powered retail recommendation system using ANNs. It analyzes customer behavior and product data to deliver personalized product suggestions, enhance discovery, and support business growth through smarter insights and engagement.
The exponential growth of digital information has transformed the retail landscape, 
demanding innovative strategies to capture and retain customers. This research introduces a 
deep learning-powered recommendation system designed to tackle challenges faced by retail 
industry in lieu of vast variety of product availability and complex behavioral patterns of its 
customers, once such being the challenge of buyer’s paradox. 
To achieve this, we propose leveraging the power of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), 
specifically Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and aim to create a robust recommendation 
system which will be trained on extensive datasets encompassing customer purchase history 
and behavior, and product attributes to generate highly accurate and personalized product 
recommendations. 
The proposed system will deliver highly personalized product recommendations, fostering a 
deeper connection between customers and products opening new horizons for the businesses 
to scale and collaborate with brand by providing them Consumer level insights which they 
don’t have access to. 
Through the strategic application of this Recommendation system retail business can benefit 
in multitude of ways such as, enhance product discovery, optimize loyalty programs with 
personalized campaigns, optimize their inventory or assortment and in doing so ultimately 
drive sustainable growth for business.
